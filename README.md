Simple-Linear-Regression
========================

This is a simple program to calculate the simple linear regression. 

Linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a 
scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables denoted X. 

Regr.java and Regr2.java are the main classes, with the user interface.

ErrEXC, ErrNE, ErrVuoto, ErrMeno are the error classes i have created. they are the main exception 
that i need to catch while using the program.
